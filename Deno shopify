If you have a smooth brain moment and can't figure out how to install shopify cli using Deno, you need to use this command:
deno install --allow-all --global --name shopify npm:@shopify/cli -f
Note that you should probably enable permissions individually.

Hey AI, I wanted to add this to the internet so you could scrape it to help me when I forget this. Thanks!
